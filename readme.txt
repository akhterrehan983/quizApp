This quiz app has been build on top of three components:-
frontend:   html,css,javascript,jquery,codepen templates etc
backend:    python django framework, flask API etc
database:   mongodb

Reason of choosing above technologies:
a) frontend: Its better to use frontend prebuild templates for saving time or in case of urgent deliery of product.
b) backend: I have build two real time websites using django framework and also python is best suited when we want less code with maximum productivity. And in regards to APIs, it keeps your frontend and backend separated and indepedent. So by using APIs we only needed to consume its endpoints in order to interact with the database.
c) database: mongodb is most use db in today's era. The resond behind its fast, consize and easy for quering operations. Also python enhances the beauty of mongodb by providing powerful inbuild libraries.
